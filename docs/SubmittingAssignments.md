1. Click on the _Git_ icon in the sidebar.
2. Hover over changes and click on the plus icon. (Or hover over each file that you want to commit and click on the plus icon.)
3. Give your commit a descriptive name where it says "Message ..."
4. Click on the checkmark icon above your message.

## Step 3: Push your Changes to your forked repository

In your terminal (in Visual Studio Code), type:

```
git push origin main
```

1. Open a browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, etc) and go to https://github.com/
