# JavaScript Frameworks

**[CanCode Communities Course](https://cancode.org/courses/)**

**Summer 2023**

This is the git repository for the class. It will be updated on a class by class basis.

You will submit your assignments by doing pull requests. You will need to create a Github account if you do not have one already. Fork this repository by clicking on the _Fork_ button. Then clone your forked repository with this command, replacing _YOUR-USERNAME_ with your Github username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/JSFrameworks2023.git
```

Add the original repository as a remote to your forked repository:

```bash
cd JSFrameworks2023
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AlbanyCanCodeCourses/JSFrameworks2023.git
git remote -v
# You should see your upstream set as https://github.com/AlbanyCanCodeCourses/JSFrameworks2023.git
git config pull.rebase false
```

At any point, it may prompt you to login in another window. If offered, choose to login with the browser. If you see the message "Please tell me who you are" in your command line output, you will need to setup your command line to use your Github account. Follow the instruction underneath where it says "Run", replacing "youremail@example.com" and "Your Name" with your information.

#### On Making Pull Requests

Whenever you are ready to submit your work, you will need to [commit your work, push to your own repository, and then make a pull request](docs/SubmittingAssignments.md).
